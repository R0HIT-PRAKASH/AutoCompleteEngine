# AutoCompleteEngine

FULL DISCLOSURE: This is a first year university project. As such, the outline of the project (how the majority of public methods are organized and how classes are coupled) was determined by the professors, NOT BY ME. I contributed most public method completion and helper methods. I did not contribute to the structure of this project. 

This code uses a recursive tree structure to store every word in some block of text. The user can then input some prefix, and the program returns all the letters or words that use this prefix. There is also a condensed version of the tree, where words not found in the input text are not stored in the tree structure, so parsing and storing can be done more efficiently.
